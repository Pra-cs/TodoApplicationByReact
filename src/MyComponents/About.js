        Beyond applications, preparing for interviews and continuous skill
        development are essential. Regularly practicing common interview
        questions, technical assessments, and mock interviews can improve
        confidence and performance. Engaging in online courses or earning
        relevant certifications demonstrates a commitment to learning and
        staying competitive in the job market. Additionally, networking through
        job fairs, webinars, and referrals enhances opportunities by connecting
        with potential employers. By following this structured to-do list,
        Prabhat can systematically navigate the job search process and increase
        the chances of landing the ideal role.
